Hello, I'm Joanna! Looking forward to meet you! :)

PROJECT TITLE: 
Python Assessment Test

This is my solution for the Python Assessment Test. This application processes voltage and current measurements and outputs plots and csv file of calculated power. Then saves it to the same directory. This application allows to calculate several files within the folder path.

BUILD STATUS:
At this point, this application is accessible via command line. There could be optimizations done on running the program, as it takes several seconds to show "Power Calculator."

CODING STYLE:
PEP8. I used package structure to have much organized code. I separated the main post processing source code to the other functions I created. 

HOW TO USE:
1. Go to the build\exe.win-amd64-3.8 path.
2. Run Pagtalunan_Python.exe
3. Wait until it shows "Power Calculator"

FEEDBACK & SUGGESTION:
I am very much open to feedback and suggestions. You might have a better solution than mine, I'd be happy to learn more about it. :)



Cheers,
Joanna
